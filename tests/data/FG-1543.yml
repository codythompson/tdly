name: FG-1543 Accurate Categorization of Endpoints with TPM Versions Lower than 2.0 in SecureSense and Endpoint Health Widget [Healthy Tech]
note: make a task for migration so can be done asap separate.
Items:
  TPM Version Display in SecureSense Panel:
    status: done?
    questions:
    - q: do we already have the TPM chip version in the DB (probably based on above)
      a: it seems like TPM version is already displayed in SecureSense panel
    - a: it is indeed in a nice column in endpoints.endpoint
      q: is it in a nice column, or is it in a JSON column (i.e. manufacturer info or something)
    existing:
      FG-1933 - Display TPM Supported Information in SecureSense Panel:
        - DONE
        - list as cloned by FG-2192 DONE
      FG-2415 - [E2E Tests] Add tests for TPM field in SecureSense page:
        - In Progress (2025-07-14)
      FG-2193 - Display TPM Supported Information in SecureSense Panel:
        - BACKLOG
        - Listed as clone of 2192, but encapsulates more work than just TPM version
        - TPM enablement status is shown in the SecureSense panel (if available).
        - TPM fields display fallback messaging when unsupported/unavailable.
        - TPM data is included in endpoint exports.
        - UI matches the structure and formatting of other SecureSense fields.
  Accurate SecureBoot Status in Endpoint Health Widget:
    status:
      - not implemented / partially implemented
    questions:
      - q:
      - a: It seems like filtering currently happens on the frontend only
        q: what does the existing filter mechanism look like for endpoints (or other entities)?
      - q: does the health widget display the counts directly from api data, or does it do it's own filter
        a: likely coming from GET /endpoints items[].endpointProperties.hasSecureBootEnabled
  TPM Version Filter:
    status:
      - not implemented
      - need to check with UI team about filtering
    existing:
      FG-1934 - Add "TPM Disabled" to Endpoint Health Widget with Filtered Endpoint View:
        - BACKLOG
        - not implemented
    questions:
      - q: 
      - q: do we/should we have existing backend filter logic
        followup: should we add/modify that logic now
